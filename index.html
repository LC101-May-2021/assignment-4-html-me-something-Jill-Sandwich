               <h2>"Enter the survival horror..."</h2>
               <p>
                  When I was around 8 years old, my first exposure to the Resident Evil series was on the Nintendo 64 with Resident Evil 2.
                  Around that time, horror games were starting to gain traction and becoming what would today be known as video game horror classics,
                  such as Nightmare Creatures, Silent Hill, and DOOM, to name a few.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Since then, the series had captivated me and fueled my fascination and love for Zombie/Biological Terror horror.<br>
                  It wasn't until years later, with the first game's remake for the Game Cube, that I really became a fan of the series,<br>
                  and found my most favorite character, Jill Valentine.

                  The story begins in the Spencer Estate Mansion in the Arklay Mountains, on the outskirts of Raccoon City,
                  a Midwestern town somewhere in the USA.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  July 24th, 1998,<br>
                  A Special Tactics and Rescue Service (S.T.A.R.S) unit from the Raccoon City Police Department is sent out to the
                  Spencer Estate to investigate the wooded area, where some bizarre and gruesome murders in the Arklay Mountains have occured.
                  After contact is lost with S.T.A.R.S. Bravo team, Alpha team is sent to investigate their disappearance, and come across Bravo's 
                  crashed helicopter and land at the site. They are soon attacked by a monstrous pack of dogs, and sprint their way to the nearby mansion.<br>
                  But little do they know the horrors and madness that they will soon face, inside this mansion riddled with puzzles and mechanisms,<br>
                  impossible creatures and the dead...created by the illegal biological weaponry research of an underground research facility sponsored by the Umbrella Corporation.<br>

               <h4>Fun Fact!</h4>
               <p id="testP" class="funParagraph">
                  It's been widely discussed by many fans and it is believed, based on the geography of the fictional city,
                  that Springfield, Missouri is a possible canon location of Raccoon City!
                  For the fact that Raccoon is on the outskirts of the Arklay Mountains,
                  and Springfield, MO is on the outskirts of the Ozark Mountains, with a similar population count and industrialization.
                  Though there are many midwestern contenders that also come close, and certainly have definitive arguements.
